Description: # cdp-py
        
        The Ciholas Data Protocol (CDP) provides a method of communication between devices and services. CDP data is transmitted over Ethernet as User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets. _cdp-py_ contains a set of structural definitions of the CDP data items that make up these UDP packets.
        
        For more information about CDP, see the official [documentation](http://cuwb.io/docs/v3.0/software-integration/cdp-output-definition/).
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
        You need Python 3 or higher to use _cdp-py_. Make sure you have Python installed and that the expected version is available from your command line. You can check this by running:
        
        ```
        $ python --version
        ```
        
        If you do not have Python, please install the latest 3.x version, available from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
        
        Additionally, you will need to make sure you have pip installed. You can check this by running:
        
        ```
        $ pip --version
        ```
        
        If you're on Linux and installed Python 3.x using your OS package manager, you may need to install pip separately.
        
        ### Installing
        
        _cdp-py_ can be installed using pip. To install the latest version use:
        
        ```
        $ pip install cdp-py
        ```
        
        Now that _cdp-py_ package is installed, you can start using the _cdp_ module by adding the following import statement to your Python script:
        
        ```python
        import cdp
        ```
        For a tutorial about how to use the _cdp_ module, visit: [Using CDP - Python](http://cuwb.io/docs/v3.0/application-notes/using-cdp-python/#using-cdp-python).
        
        ### Upgrading
        
        To upgrade to the latest version use:
        
        ```
        $ pip install --upgrade cdp-py
        ```
